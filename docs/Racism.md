# Racism

- Word used to describe both the act of judging, attacking, diminishing someone based on their race and the system through which racial difference was made possible
- Being a structural phenomenon in modern societies, not every aggression based on race can be termed racism, which occurs only when the currently dominant race perpetuates such aggression
