# Almeida, Silvio - Racismo estrutural

## Central questions
- How can [racism](Racism.md) be correctly approached?
- How do race relate to economics, politics, the law and society?

## Theses
- Racism is always structural
- It is also mediated by economics, politics, the law and society
- All modern societies are either direct or indirectly racist

## Arguments
- The individual perspective understands racism as an external factor to modern societies, a kind of social disease maculating what would be a perfectly balanced society
- The institutional perspective understands racism as a power relation, which is an advancement regarding the preceding interpretation, but it
    1.  fails to address the cause through which institutional racism is created 
    2.  limits the scope of racism to the institutions
- Racism must be seen, then, as something structural to modern societies
