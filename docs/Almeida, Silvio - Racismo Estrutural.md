# Almeida, Silvio - Racismo estrutural

## Central questions
- How can [racism](Racism.md) be correctly approached?
- How do race relate to economics, politics, the law and society?

## Theses
- Racism is always structural
- It is also mediated by economics, politics, the law and society
- All modern societies are either direct or indirectly racist

## Arguments
- The individual perspective understands racism as an external factor to modern societies, a kind of social disease maculating what would be a perfectly balanced society
  - This explains individual racist acts but doesn't account for police brutality towards black people, for example, which is actually a institutional problem
    - If it wasn't, how can there be so many so-called _individual cases_ of police brutality in a so large quantity that it, in truth, demonstrates how racism surpasses the individual level?  
- The institutional perspective understands racism as a power relation found inside social institutions such as the political system, which is an advancement regarding the preceding interpretation, but it still
    1.  fails to address the cause through which institutional racism is created 
    2.  limits the scope of racism to the institutions
- Racism must be seen, then, as something structural to modern societies, pertaining to all of it albeit in different ways
