The [article](https://aeon.co/essays/yacob-and-amo-africas-precursors-to-locke-hume-and-kant) at [Aeon](Aeon.md). Available in portuguese [here](Herbjornsrud,%20Dag%20-%20O%20Iluminismo%20Africano.md).

## Central questions



## Theses

- The Enlightenment is usually seen with the lens of exceptionalism, biased towards Europe and its thinkers — Descartes, Locke, Newton, Hume, Voltaire, and Kant
- But there were African thinkers who posited Enlightenment ideals before the European authors
  - Zera Yacob
  - Anton Amo
- The theoretical endeavors of European authors contradict what is usually taken as their theory, _i.e._, while they were assumed to be free thinkers, their writings prove their preconceptions regarding race and gender, absent in the thought of their African peers

## Arguments

We can observe a contrast between the African authors and the following European authors:

### Kant
- Kant sees women as intelectually inferior to men, whose desire for them has a mere sexual nature, and understands the white race as the highest point of humanity
- Yacob sees women as men's partner, principally regarding the intellectual aspect, and sees humans as rational beings with equal capacities, delegitimizing slavery

### Locke
- Locke proposes total intolerance against atheists while arguing the world was given as God's gift to the industrious and rational humans
  - This can be seen as an argument towards the legitimization of colonial rule ([Julie K. Ward](http://www.thecritique.com/articles/the-roots-of-modern-racism/)) 
- Yacob understands how every believer believes their faith to be the only truthful one
