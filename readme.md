# Darlim's garden

**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my digital garden!**

## What is a digital garden?
It's basically a collection of notes, thoughts, and writings. Similar to a [non-digital garden](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46964/46964-h/46964-h.htm), we can think of it as something divine but also human. This is a continuous work in progress: don't panic if you find something wrong.

## How do you make yourself a <del>[body without organs](https://www.generation-online.org/p/fpdeleuze2.htm)</del> digital garden?

I made mine using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template). 
I found Foam to be the easiest solution among others, including:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) + [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
- [[Obsidian]] + [MkDocs](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs)

Of course, these options could work for you. Try them!
